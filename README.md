Distinct Elements Sum Algorithm

Description

This project contains a simple written algorithm  that calculates the " sum of distinct elements " from two integer arrays (sets).
An element is considered " distinct " if it exists in only one of the two arrays.

Example


Set 1: [3, 1, 7, 9]
Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
 
The output will be : 13
